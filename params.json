Both to brush up my 3D math skills as well as practice writing a\r\npiece of software in C++. Currently it runs on 32bit Windows and requires the VS2012 runtime. I may port it to other\r\nplatforms later.\r\n\r\nMay aim is it to implement a functional 3D renderer using raytracing. This includes soft shadows, mesh lights, textured\r\nmodels and some more. I'll also try to keep all that in realtime, though I might sacrifice that constraint in exchange\r\nfor cool features.\r\n\r\n###Progress###\r\n\r\n![Hard Shadows](img/hard_shadows.png)\r\nMay 9th 13: Hard shadows\r\n\r\n\r\n![Point Lights](img/point_lights.png)\r\nMay 9th 13: Point lights\r\n\r\n![Reflections](img/reflections.png)\r\nMay 10th 13: Reflections\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
