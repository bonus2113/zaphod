###About###

This project is intented as a learning experience. Both to brush up my 3D math skills as well as practice writing a
piece of software in C++. Currently it runs on 32bit Windows and requires the VS2012 runtime. I may port it to other
platforms later.

May aim is it to implement a functional 3D renderer using raytracing. This includes soft shadows, mesh lights, textured
models and some more. I'll also try to keep all that in realtime, though I might sacrifice that constraint in exchange
for cool features.
